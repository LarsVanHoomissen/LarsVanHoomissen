- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @LarsVanHoomissen
I'm currently a 16-year-old student with high motivation in Software development and data engineering. 
I'm also working on machine learning and deep learning neural network projects with Pytorch and making WPF applications with C# and XAML. 
I have experience with BI tools like Tableau and Microsoft Azure. In my free time, 
I follow many courses and set my goals to earn a certification and learn many new things.

Here's what I've personally been doing over the last few years:

â€¢ Learning and making supervised deep learning neural networks in Python with libraries like Pytorch.

â€¢ Learning data science, learning to build data pipelines, and visualizing big data with python Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas, and building linear regression models.

â€¢ Building WPF applications with XAML and C# and working on side projects.

â€¢ Building BI dashboards in Tableau and visualizing datasets from Kaggle.

â€¢Building Android apps with XAML and C# .net core

If you have questions please contact me.
